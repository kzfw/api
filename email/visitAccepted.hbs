		Hello {{name}}, <br /><br />
		On behalf of the Fort Worth vARTCC, we're happy to have you join our team! By choosing ZFW, you have selected to join one of the largest reagions in VATUSA and one that prides
		itself always striving for excellence.  <br /><br />First, please login on ZFW's website, easily located at www.zfwartcc.net! This is required! If you encounter an
		issue with this please email datm@zfwartcc.net with your CID and the issue you are encountering. <br /><br />All new controllers to our community should read through
		the entire Training Department section on the ZFW website. This will help familiarize yourself with the Fort Worth vARTCC website, such as our Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
		and Letters of Agreement (LOA). Please start now to be prepared to complete the ZFW Basic SOP exam, a requirement to begin training! The SOP has already been assigned.
		Check the Academy website in the ZFW course for it. <br /><br />We strongly suggest visiting Training Frequently Asked Questions to help get started on your journey! Please
		take time to read the provided links and other supplemental information to assist in your online ATC career with Fort Worth. Our goal is to help everyone have the best experience
		possible while participating in this pastime. This means independent work is an absolute necessity. The value of your own reading of materials, your own observations of other
		controllers and practice cannot be overstated.<br /><br />Lastly, we'd love to have you join our ZFW Community Discord. I strongly encourage you to join, it'll be the easiest
		way to ask questions and get to know everyone. Join using this link: https://discord.gg/acXKEDE62n.<br /><br /> Please join us on our Team speak at ts.zfwartcc.net  PW: zfwrocks!<br /><br />we are looking forward to working with you and hope you will find
